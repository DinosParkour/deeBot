# deeBot
deeBot is a multi-fuction Discord Bot, powered by [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA).

I have been developing it since January 2016(!) and as of August 2019,
it has been added to 15K servers with approximately **1 million users** in total.

deeBot has been a fun project that helped me experiment and learn many cool technologies.
It was originally written in Java, but I have continued with Kotlin since v3.0.
Along the process, I have had the chance to play with MySQL, Linux Servers, Java Reflections, REST APIs etc.

Feel free to fork and modify it however you want to fit your needs.
If you want to include parts of it in your public bot, let me know in advance and give credit where it's due (:
